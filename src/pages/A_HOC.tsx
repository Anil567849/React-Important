/*
Theory:
An HOC is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component with enhanced or modified behavior.

Key Concepts of HOCs
1. Pure Function: An HOC is a pure function with no side effects. It doesn't modify the original component but returns a new component with added functionality.

2. Composability: HOCs are great for code reuse. You can compose them to add multiple layers of functionality to a component.

3. Props Manipulation: HOCs can inject, modify, or remove props that are passed to the wrapped component.

4. Wrapper Components: The new component created by the HOC wraps the original one, potentially adding additional behavior, such as managing state or enhancing the UI.
